This section focuses on the foundational topics that every SQL beginner should grasp. These core concepts lay the groundwork for understanding how databases function and how we interact with them using SQL.

## Topics Covered:
- **Database and Database Types**
- **Data Types**
- **Constraints**
- **Types of SQL Commands**

### 1. **Database and Database Types**
In this section, I explore the concept of a **database**, how data is stored, and the different types of databases:

- **Relational Databases**: Data is stored in tables with relationships between them (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Non-Relational Databases**: More flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

### 2. **Data Types**
Understanding **data types** is essential when defining the structure of the database and creating tables. In this section, I cover the most commonly used data types in SQL:

- **CHAR, VARCHAR**: For storing text.
- **INT, FLOAT**: For numerical values.
- **DATE, TIME**: For storing dates and times.
- **BOOLEAN**: For true/false values.

### 3. **Constraints**
Constraints are rules that limit the type of data that can be inserted into a table. This section explains the various **SQL constraints** used to enforce data integrity:

- **PRIMARY KEY**: Ensures uniqueness and is used to uniquely identify records.
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Ensures referential integrity between two tables.
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.
- **CHECK**: Ensures that values in a column meet a specified condition.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.

### 4. **Types of SQL Commands**
SQL commands are categorized based on their functionality. This section introduces the main categories of SQL commands:

- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Includes commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` used for managing data.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Includes commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` for defining and modifying the database schema.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Includes commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to control user access.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: Includes commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` for managing transactions.
